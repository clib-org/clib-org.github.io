This organisation on GitHub will create a bunch of libraries for both C and C++
and most important it will develop a package manager called `cpm` which will allow
you to have `npm` like functionality for C/C++. This will greatly improve
your ability to share dependencies across multiple systems and to create
reproducible builds everywhere.
