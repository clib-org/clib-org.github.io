This is the begining of cpm!

### What is this?

`cpm` is short for **C[++] Package Manager**. Bellow I will describe why it is
usefull and what this is all about.

### Why should I care?

Right now it is kinda hard to ensure reproducible across various machines. There
are many issues that prevent this:

  1. Dependencies
  2. Dependencies
  3. Platform-specific Issues

You might ask yourself why dependencies is listed twice? It's because there are
actually two dependencie issues here:

  1. Compilation
  2. Runtime

The first seems easy to solve with the tools we have today, like `apt`. The issue
is that there are many different package managers across many different operating
systems and distros. Each will serve a different or even modified version of a
curtain library.

The second issue is even worse. While languages like go allow you to bundle
everything in a singe executable, C/C++ does not do this automaticaly. I know,
you will argue, that C/C++ allow static linking which solves this issue but you
still need to get the libraries somewhere.

### How will this solve any problems?

To solve any problem, we need to view cpm in two perspectives:

#### 1. Build System

The current solutions (GNU Autotools or CMake) are great, don't get me wrong here.
But I think a modern build system should follow a few rules which are missing in
the existing solutions (or are not that easy to do). So for cpm, there are the
following general rules:

  1. **Clean Source Tree**: The source of your project should remain as clean as
  possible to make it easier to work with and to distribute it. All generated files
  should be stored in `build/`. For Example object files could be placed in `build/obj/`
  while binaries could be stored in `build/bin/` and so on.

  2. **Incremental Builds**: Object files should only be compiled if a dependency
  changes. This ensures higher build speeds for large projects. (You shuold note,
  that this feature is basicly available in every build system out there)

  3. **Local Dependencies**: If your repository contains a binary project and a
  library project it should be easy to use the library in the binary project.

  4. **System Checks**: You should be able to define some stuff that you need from
  the system and/or the compiler (e.g. `C++11`).

  5. **Basic Packaging Support**: Distributing your package via package managers
  like `apt` or `rpm` or `pacman` requires the same work for every project. It would
  be nice if your build system would be able to do this for you!

### What about Licenses/Costs?

cpm is open source and released under the MIT License which allows you to use
cpm in almost every situation. If you have any issues with this License, please
open an Issue, because it is our number one priority that cpm can be used everywhere!
